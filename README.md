# fibonacci_visuals
This will take advantage of the python bokeh module to visualize neat things regarding the fibonacci sequence

Forthcoming:
    -A visual showing how well the approximation of phi matches the true value
    -The squares/spiral if possible
    -I've thought about adding a slide bar (or something similar) for the number of fibonacci terms

Will do more reading on the fibonacci sequence for other neat things to possibly show
